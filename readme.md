## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic
- Estimating significant variables which effect the demand of sharing bikes so that BoomBikes wants to be ready after the covid pandemic
- Bike Sharing dataset is used to understand the demand

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Data Preparation: Preparation of Data into more meaning full and Understanding Data
- Model Building : Build Linear Regression Model to estimates the factors of demand of Bike Sharing
- Model Evaluation : Check the Model built on the test data set
